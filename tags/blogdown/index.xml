      <description>Having decided to write a blog I needed something to write about. The purpose of this blog will be to link up various projects I work on and to share code and ideas.
Currently I mostly work with R and use it for statistics, modelling, GIS and web based reporting. Therefore the choice of Blogdown as a platform seemed simple enough. You will find many existing posts about others setting up their blogs in a similar way.</description>
