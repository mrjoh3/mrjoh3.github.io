      <description>In an effort to resurrect my long neglected blogdown site, I decided to switch to a new theme. It is possible to use blogdown::install_theme() to get you started adding a new theme. But I wanted to do the update manually and then start to modify the theme to suit my needs. For R coders sometimes other languages and interacting with HTML and CSS can be intimidating but the results are very satisfying.</description>

      <description>Currently I mostly work with R and use it for statistics, modelling, GIS and web / pdf based reporting. Therefore the choice of Blogdown seemed simple enough. You will find many existing posts about others setting up their blogs in a similar way. Further, the book blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown by Yihui Xie et al. covers everything you need to know about the process. Here, I am only going to discuss the few specific issues I had to deal with to get started.</description>
