# DRAFT

Some time ago I had to implement an image gallery within a `shiny` application. A simple grid of small thumbnail images where clicking opens the full image.  Nothing complicated, but I did have several requirements:

  1. The gallery needed to render from a folder of images
  2. The gallery interface and thumbnails needed to be responsive
  3. The gallery needed to link to other `shiny` UI
  4. The full-size image should be zoomable to see the full resolution.
  
There is a wide variety of javascript image gallery implementations. To start with I looked at  [Lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) and [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/). Lightbox was the easiest to use and many other JS libraries are based on it. Photoswipe is also very popular with a very nice UI, zoom and touch integration plus an extensive API. Both are available under MIT licences. Unfortunately my javascript is limited and I did not have enough time to get more than the most basic Photoswipe gallery to work. But, the Lightbox gallery works very nicely.

This work was eventually built into a [shiny app](https://mrjoh3.shinyapps.io/shiny-gallery-example/) so you can see the galleries in action. I have also wrapped the code in the [gallerier](https://github.com/mrjoh3/gallerier) package. `Gallerier` can be used in both `shiny` and `rmarkdown` documents. Code for the original `shiny` app is on [Github](https://github.com/mrjoh3/shiny-gallery-example).


## Data Preparation


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(hashids)
library(gallerier)

images <- data.frame(src = list.files('www/img')) %>%
  tidyr::separate(col = 'src', 
                  c('txt', 'date', 'time', 'msec'), 
                  sep = '_|\\.', 
                  remove = FALSE) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date),
         key = hashids::encode(1e3 + as.integer(msec), 
                               hashid_settings(salt = 'this is my salt')))

```

```r
## simple lightbox
lightbox_gallery(images, 
                 'gallery', 
                 display = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# small hack for use in blogdown site
images %>%
  mutate(src = paste0('/', src)) %>%
  lightbox_gallery(., 'gallery', 
                   display = TRUE)
```
