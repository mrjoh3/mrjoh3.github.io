# DRAFT

Recently I had to implement an image gallery within a `shiny` application. A simple grid of small images where clicking opens the fullscreen image.  Nothing complicated, but I did have several requirements:

  1. The gallery needed to render from a folder of images
  2. The gallery interface and thumbnails needed to be responsive
  3. The gallery needed to link to other `shiny` UI
  4. The fullsize image should be zoomable to see the full resolution.
  
There is a wide variety of javascript image gallery implimentations. Here I will detail minimalist implimentations of [Lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) and [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/). Lightbox was choosen as it seems easiest to impliment and many other JS libraries are based on it. Photoswipe is another very popular implimentation with a very nice UI, touch integration and extensive API. Both are available under MIT licences.

The examples discussed here have been built into a working [shiny app](https://mrjoh3.shinyapps.io/shiny-gallery-example/) so you can see the functionality of each. Code for the app is on [Github](https://github.com/mrjoh3/shiny-gallery-example).


## Data Preparation


```r
images <- data.frame(src = list.files('www/img')) %>%
  tidyr::separate(col = 'src', c('txt', 'date', 'time', 'msec'), sep = '_|\\.', remove = FALSE) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date),
         key = hashids::encode(1e3 + as.integer(msec), hashid_settings(salt = 'this is my salt')))


```
