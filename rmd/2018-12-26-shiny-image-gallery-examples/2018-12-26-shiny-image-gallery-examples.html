<h1>DRAFT</h1>
<p>Recently I had to implement an image gallery within a <code>shiny</code> application. A simple grid of small images where clicking opens the fullscreen image. Nothing complicated, but I did have several requirements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The gallery needed to render from a folder of images</li>
<li>The gallery interface and thumbnails needed to be responsive</li>
<li>The gallery needed to link to other <code>shiny</code> UI</li>
<li>The fullsize image should be zoomable to see the full resolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a wide variety of javascript image gallery implimentations. Here I will detail minimalist implimentations of <a href="https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lightbox</a> and <a href="http://photoswipe.com/">PhotoSwipe</a>. Lightbox was choosen as it seems easiest to impliment and many other JS libraries are based on it. Photoswipe is another very popular implimentation with a very nice UI, touch integration and extensive API. Both are available under MIT licences.</p>
<p>The examples discussed here have been built into a working <a href="https://mrjoh3.shinyapps.io/shiny-gallery-example/">shiny app</a> so you can see the functionality of each. Code for the app is on <a href="https://github.com/mrjoh3/shiny-gallery-example">Github</a>.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>images &lt;- data.frame(src = list.files(&#39;www/img&#39;)) %&gt;%
  tidyr::separate(col = &#39;src&#39;, c(&#39;txt&#39;, &#39;date&#39;, &#39;time&#39;, &#39;msec&#39;), sep = &#39;_|\\.&#39;, remove = FALSE) %&gt;%
  rowwise() %&gt;%
  mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date),
         key = hashids::encode(1e3 + as.integer(msec), hashid_settings(salt = &#39;this is my salt&#39;)))
