      <description>ggtrack   Sometimes in a workplace it is hard to know exactly where or when a specific chart has been produced. This is especially true when someone has copied a chart out of a report to use somewhere else. The ggtrack package aims to solve this problem by embedding enough metadata in the charts image to identify the source and the exact time it was produced.</description>

      <description>mapedit.addin  
The goal of mapedit.addin is to simplify the creation of spatial data by wrapping the mapedit package. As you can see in the code below the mapedit package already makes the process very simple.
library(mapview) library(mapedit) new_spatial_data &amp;lt;- mapview() %&amp;gt;% editMap() All mappedit.addin does is wrap this piece of code in an RStudio addin. This means that the process of creating spatial data and saving it to file is completed using only GUI tools.</description>
