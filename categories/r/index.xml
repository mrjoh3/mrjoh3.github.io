      <description>Some time ago I had to implement an image gallery within a shiny application. A simple grid of small thumbnail images where clicking opens the full image. Nothing complicated, but I did have several requirements:
The gallery needed to render from a folder of images The gallery interface and thumbnails needed to be responsive The gallery needed to link to other shiny UI Images come from one location, no need for generating thumbnails  There is a wide variety of javascript image gallery implementations.</description>

      <description>ggtrack   Sometimes in a workplace it is hard to know exactly where or when a specific chart has been produced. This is especially true when someone has copied a chart out of a report to use somewhere else. The ggtrack package aims to solve this problem by embedding enough metadata in the charts image to identify the source and the exact time it was produced.</description>

      <description>A HTMLWidget wrapper for the Cytoscape.js graph / network visualisation and analysis library. There are already a number of existing R packages for Cytoscape such as the Bioconductor package and the official Cytoscape Widget. The purpose of this package is to make the process of producing a basic chart as simple as possible.

      <description>mapedit.addin  
The goal of mapedit.addin is to simplify the creation of spatial data by wrapping the mapedit package. As you can see in the code below the mapedit package already makes the process very simple.
library(mapview) library(mapedit) new_spatial_data &amp;lt;- mapview() %&amp;gt;% editMap() All mappedit.addin does is wrap this piece of code in an RStudio addin. This means that the process of creating spatial data and saving it to file is completed using only GUI tools.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spatial Data with Crosstalk</title>

      <description>hljs.highlightAll(); In a previous post I wanted to look at the daily pattern of motor vehicle accidents across the state of Victoria. What I am really interested in though is the accidents in my local area.
To do this I am going to use leaflet, sf to handle all the spatial data and crosstalk to filter the data visible in the map. The crosstalk package enables a level of interactivity that is usually reserved for more complex server (shiny) based applications.</description>

      <description>Currently I mostly work with R and use it for statistics, modelling, GIS and web / pdf based reporting. Therefore the choice of Blogdown seemed simple enough. You will find many existing posts about others setting up their blogs in a similar way. Further, the book blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown by Yihui Xie et al. covers everything you need to know about the process. Here, I am only going to discuss the few specific issues I had to deal with to get started.</description>
